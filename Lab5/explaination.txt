The output of the program rd_wr first has the writer print its I.D. and then each reader prints its own I.D. and the value written into the shared variable. Each reader prints this 5 times. Then the next writer writes, and each writer writes a value 4 times each. There also random newlines within the program, because the program does not execute properly without printf() calls at certain points in the program. This might have to do with timing, but that does not really explain why the program enters an endless loop without printf() calls.
