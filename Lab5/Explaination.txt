The output of the program starts with a writer, so that the stock value is written and the buffer is readable. Then threads randomly recieve access to the buffer, and are able to read or write. It is more difficult for the writers to get access to the buffer, as readers get priority and so it is likely that one written value will have many readers, and that the last threads to execute will be writers.
